# jQuery-Event-Methods
jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page.

# What are Events?
All the different visitor' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happends.

Example

    .moving a mouse over an element
    .selection a radion button
    .clicking on an element

The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress  event
is fired, the moment you press a key".

Here are some commong DOM events:

    Mouse Event   -->  Keywrod Events --> Form Events -->  Document/Window Events

    click          --> keypress      -->  submit -->        load

    dbclick        -->  keydown      --> change -->         resize

    moseenter       -->  keyup       --> focus  -->         scroll

    moseleave       -->                   blurr  -->      unload
